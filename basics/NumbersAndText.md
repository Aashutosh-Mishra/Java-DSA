## Numbers and Texts
In programming, we can directly use some fixed values in our program. These fixed values are called literals.

Let's take a look at commonly used literals in Java.

1. Integers (int)
Integers are numbers without decimal parts. For example, 5, -11, 0, 12, etc. For now, let's refer to integers as simply int.

2. Floating-point Numbers (double)
Floating-point numbers contain decimal parts. For example, 2.5, 6.76, 0.0, -9.45, etc. For now, let's refer to floating-point numbers as double.

3. String (text)
In Java, texts wrapped inside double quotation marks are called Strings.

"This is a string"

``` Java
//integer//
class main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(33);
    }
}
```



```Java
//String//
class main{
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Java is easy");
    }
}
```





```Java
// String,Number,Float//
class main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hey");
        System.out.println(33);
        System.out.println(44.41f);
    }
}
```
